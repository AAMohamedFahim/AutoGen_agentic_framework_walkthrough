## Chapter 1: Setting Up AutoGen with Azure and GROQ

In this chapter, you will learn how to set up the AutoGen framework with **Azure OpenAI** and **GROQ APIs**. This involves configuring your environment, setting up the necessary API keys, and creating a basic agent that can interact with these models.

## Chapter 2: Conversable Agent Workflow

The ConversableAgent class in the Autogen package is a powerful tool for creating intelligent, conversational AI agents. It enables developers to:

- Build chatbots and virtual assistants
- Interact with multiple language models
- Configure agents with custom settings
- Simulate conversations between different agents

Key features include:

- Flexible configuration with API key mapping
- Customizable agent behaviors
- Conversation history tracking
- Conditional conversation termination

The class allows for sophisticated multi-agent interactions, such as a simulated conversation between a customer and a shopkeeper, demonstrating its versatility in creating context-driven, dynamic conversational scenarios.
